- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The Denial of Service attack occurs when a server is overwhelmed with more requests than it can handle.
This causes the server to crash and stop responding to any further requests.

The secure version incroporates try-catch blocks that are fundamental to handling erorrs gracefully and 
returning a response to the client. This ensures that the server does not crash at unexpected times.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Rate limiting and using CDNs to balance loads are two additional methods by which DDoS attacks can be prevented.
