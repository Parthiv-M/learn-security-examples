Exposing session IDs which can be intercepted by attackers, thereby giving them unauthorised access, is the

The secure version of the server prevents this by encrypting session data and using HTTPS, thus making it difficult
for the attackers to extract useful data from the intercepted network traffic.

Spoofing violates confidentiality (C).
