Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The insecure server can potentially accept database queries as the input, which can lead to a flushing out of data 
from the database, thereby revealing secure information about the application's users. This can lead to noSQL injection attacks.

Information disclosure violates integrity (I).

Input validation, stripping user inputs of any unwanted trailing or leading characters, as well as using parametrised queries
are good methods to fight this vulnerability.
