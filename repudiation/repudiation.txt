- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
This vulnerability leverages the system's inability to trace malicious users. If a malicious actor decides to tamper the system
and perform unauthorised actions and the system cannot trace it, the system is vulnerable to such attacks.

The secure version implements appropriate logging at all possible points in the system so that such attacks are not possible.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Implement auditing policies and sufficient logging. Also make sure that logs cannot be tampered easily.
