Privilege escalation occurs when unauthorised users get higher privileges than they are entitled to receive. This can grant 
access to resources that are beyond their intended level of authorisation.

The secure version of the server implements session based authorisation. This allows only intended users to get the privileges 
required by, say, an admin user as it is cross-verified agianst their session information.

Additional measures: role based access control
